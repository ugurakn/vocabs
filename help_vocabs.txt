
	    WELCOME TO VOCABS!

Vocabs allows you to create your own dictionary 
of words and exercise with them. The program is 
divided into four sections and how to best use 
each one is detailed below. 

You can reach this help section by clicking on
HELP or by pressing H on the main screen.

ADD WORDS

You can enter new words into your personal 
dictionary on this screen. A word and a meaning
must be entered in order to be able to save the
word. Entering its type (e.g., noun, verb, adj)
is also highly recommended. When you enter the
type of a noun or a verb, enter "n" or "noun" and
"v" or "verb", respectively. For other types of 
words you can enter the type however you want.   
        
SEE WORDS (Personal Dictionary)

This is your personal dictionary and you can see 
all the words you've added and their meanings on 
this screen. Clicking on the words allows you to
see their details as well (type, article, gender;
depending on the language you are learning and
the type of the word). You can sort the words
alphabetically or by the last one added. You can
also see only recently added words, either weekly
or monthly (last added first).   


WORD EXERCISE

This exercise allows you to test your knowledge 
of the words in your personal dictionary. You
can see whether your answer was correct as well
as the correct answer itself. The program 
automatically goes on to another question after 
displaying the correct answer. When you enter a 
wrong answer, the program waits a bit longer to 
make sure that you see the correct answer 
before moving on to another word.
  

SPELLING EXERCISE

This exercise allows you to test your spelling
knowledge of the words in your personal 
dictionary. Depending on the length of the word,
it displays one or two letters of the word and 
gives you its meaning. You need the spell the 
word in its entirety (not just filling in the 
blanks) in order for the program to accept your
answer as correct. The program automatically 
goes on to another question after displaying the
correct answer. If you enter a wrong answer, 
the program waits a bit longer to make sure that 
you see the correct answer before moving on to 
another word.

OPTIONS 

You can open the options menu by clicking on 
OPTIONS or pressing O on the main screen. 

This menu allows you to limit the pool of words
the program tests you on in the Word Exercise 
and the Spelling Exercise. You can define this 
pool of words by size (last 50 words added).  

Please be aware that the options menu go back 
to default settings whenever the program is shut 
down and relaunched.
