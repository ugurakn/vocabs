# Vocabs is a simple vocabulary-learning program created in Python
 The GUI was made with Tkinter and the database is based on Sqlite3

 Simply, Vocabs allows its users to save new words that they learn in a language and practice them.
 The default language for which the program was designed is Italian, although it should work fine with other Romance languages.

 Vocabs_eng is for English vocabulary and is slightly different in the way it saves and displays words.
