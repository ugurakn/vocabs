# Vocabs is a simple vocabulary-learning program created in Python
# The GUI was made with Tkinter and the database is based on Sqlite3

# Simply, Vocabs allows its users to save new words that they learn in a language and practice them.
# The default language for which the program was designed is Italian, although it should work fine with other Romance languages.

# Vocabs_eng is for English vocabulary and is slightly different in the way it saves and displays words.
